Aim: To create a Dashboard that analyses the computer market dataset to identify key pricing
drivers and unit distribution trends. The goal is to provide stakeholders with an interactive
overview of how device type, operating system, brand, and CPU manufacturer influence
average price and market share.

The "Computer Market Dashboard" provides a clear, high-level overview of pricing and unit
distribution. Its key strengths are the direct comparisons of average price by OS, device type,
and brand, identifying immediate market segments.
The inclusion of total units and average price KPIs offers a quick summary. Price KPIs
are quantifiable metrics used to measure the effectiveness of pricing strategies and optimize
business goals like profitability and competitiveness.
The device count by CPU brand pie chart effectively visualizes market share. However, the
dashboard lacks temporal analysis (e.g., price over time) and correlation metrics (e.g.,
RAM/storage vs price). It functions well as a static summary for high-level decision-making
but requires more depth for granular analysis of performance or value.
